## 🚨 The Problem
Open Source maintainers are burning out. Thousands of Pull Requests (PRs) go unreviewed because maintainers lack the time to manually check every single contribution. Bad PRs clutter the repo, while good ideas die in the backlog.

## 🤖 The Solution
**OS-Maintainer** is an autonomous AI agent that acts as a **First-Line Gatekeeper**. It listens to repository events 24/7, analyzes incoming code, and enforces contribution rules automatically.

Unlike generic coding bots, OS-Maintainer is designed for **Safety and Trust**:
* It does not blindly merge code.
* It acts as a "Senior Reviewer," requesting changes when rules are violated.
* It runs locally in a secure Docker sandbox.

## ⚙️ Architecture

1.  **The Ears (Ngrok + Webhooks):** Listens for real-time GitHub events (Open PR, Comment, Push).
2.  **The Nervous System (Kestra):** Orchestrates the workflow, managing inputs, triggers, and execution flow.
3.  **The Brain (Google Gemini 2.5):** Analyzes the context (PR Title, Diff, Rules) to make intelligent decisions.
4.  **The Voice (GitHub API):** Posts semantic comments directly to the PR (Approvals or Change Requests).

## 🚀 Key Features

* **⚡ Instant Event Detection:** Wakes up immediately when a PR is opened.
* **🧠 Semantic Analysis:** Understands if a PR title follows conventions (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`).
* **💬 Automated Feedback:** Posts friendly, constructive comments to contributors.
* **🔒 Secure Execution:** Runs entirely within a Docker container; secrets are never exposed to the AI model.
